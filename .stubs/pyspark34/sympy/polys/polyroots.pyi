    Returns a list of roots of a quartic polynomial.

    There are many references for solving quartic expressions available [1-5].
    This reviewer has found that many of them require one to select from among
    2 or more possible sets of solutions and that some solutions work when one
    is searching for real roots but do not work when searching for complex roots
    (though this is not always stated clearly). The following routine has been
    tested and found to be correct for 0, 2 or 4 complex roots.

    The quasisymmetric case solution [6] looks for quartics that have the form
    `x**4 + A*x**3 + B*x**2 + C*x + D = 0` where `(C/A)**2 = D`.

    Although no general solution that is always applicable for all
    coefficients is known to this reviewer, certain conditions are tested
    to determine the simplest 4 expressions that can be returned:

      1) `f = c + a*(a**2/8 - b/2) == 0`
      2) `g = d - a*(a*(3*a**2/256 - b/16) + c/4) = 0`
      3) if `f != 0` and `g != 0` and `p = -d + a*c/4 - b**2/12` then
        a) `p == 0`
        b) `p != 0`

    Computes symbolic roots of a univariate polynomial.

    Given a univariate polynomial f with symbolic coefficients (or
    a list of the polynomial's coefficients), returns a dictionary
    with its roots and their multiplicities.

    Only roots expressible via radicals will be returned.  To get
    a complete set of roots use RootOf class or numerical methods
    instead. By default cubic and quartic formulas are used in
    the algorithm. To disable them because of unreadable output
    set ``cubics=False`` or ``quartics=False`` respectively. If cubic
    roots are real but are expressed in terms of complex numbers
    (casus irreducibilis [1]) the ``trig`` flag can be set to True to
    have the solutions returned in terms of cosine and inverse cosine
    functions.

    To get roots from a specific domain set the ``filter`` flag with
    one of the following specifiers: Z, Q, R, I, C. By default all
    roots are returned (this is equivalent to setting ``filter='C'``).

    By default a dictionary is returned giving a compact result in
    case of multiple roots.  However to get a list containing all
    those roots set the ``multiple`` flag to True; the list will
    have identical roots appearing next to each other in the result.
    (For a given Poly, the all_roots method will give the roots in
    sorted numerical order.)

    If the ``strict`` flag is True, ``UnsolvableFactorError`` will be
    raised if the roots found are known to be incomplete (because
    some roots are not expressible in radicals).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Poly, roots, degree
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y

    >>> roots(x**2 - 1, x)
    {-1: 1, 1: 1}

    >>> p = Poly(x**2-1, x)
    >>> roots(p)
    {-1: 1, 1: 1}

    >>> p = Poly(x**2-y, x, y)

    >>> roots(Poly(p, x))
    {-sqrt(y): 1, sqrt(y): 1}

    >>> roots(x**2 - y, x)
    {-sqrt(y): 1, sqrt(y): 1}

    >>> roots([1, 0, -1])
    {-1: 1, 1: 1}

    ``roots`` will only return roots expressible in radicals. If
    the given polynomial has some or all of its roots inexpressible in
    radicals, the result of ``roots`` will be incomplete or empty
    respectively.

    Example where result is incomplete:

    >>> roots((x-1)*(x**5-x+1), x)
    {1: 1}

    In this case, the polynomial has an unsolvable quintic factor
    whose roots cannot be expressed by radicals. The polynomial has a
    rational root (due to the factor `(x-1)`), which is returned since
    ``roots`` always finds all rational roots.

    Example where result is empty:

    >>> roots(x**7-3*x**2+1, x)
    {}

    Here, the polynomial has no roots expressible in radicals, so
    ``roots`` returns an empty dictionary.

    The result produced by ``roots`` is complete if and only if the
    sum of the multiplicity of each root is equal to the degree of
    the polynomial. If strict=True, UnsolvableFactorError will be
    raised if the result is incomplete.

    The result can be be checked for completeness as follows:

    >>> f = x**3-2*x**2+1
    >>> sum(roots(f, x).values()) == degree(f, x)
    True
    >>> f = (x-1)*(x**5-x+1)
    >>> sum(roots(f, x).values()) == degree(f, x)
    False

def sqrt(arg, evaluate: Incomplete | None = None):
    """Returns the principal square root.

    Parameters
    ==========

    evaluate : bool, optional
        The parameter determines if the expression should be evaluated.
        If ``None``, its value is taken from
        ``global_parameters.evaluate``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import sqrt, Symbol, S
    >>> x = Symbol('x')

    >>> sqrt(x)
    sqrt(x)

    >>> sqrt(x)**2
    x

    Note that sqrt(x**2) does not simplify to x.

    >>> sqrt(x**2)
    sqrt(x**2)

    This is because the two are not equal to each other in general.
    For example, consider x == -1:

    >>> from sympy import Eq
    >>> Eq(sqrt(x**2), x).subs(x, -1)
    False

    This is because sqrt computes the principal square root, so the square may
    put the argument in a different branch.  This identity does hold if x is
    positive:

    >>> y = Symbol('y', positive=True)
    >>> sqrt(y**2)
    y

    You can force this simplification by using the powdenest() function with
    the force option set to True:

    >>> from sympy import powdenest
    >>> sqrt(x**2)
    sqrt(x**2)
    >>> powdenest(sqrt(x**2), force=True)
    x

    To get both branches of the square root you can use the rootof function:

    >>> from sympy import rootof

    >>> [rootof(x**2-3,i) for i in (0,1)]
    [-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)]

    Although ``sqrt`` is printed, there is no ``sqrt`` function so looking for
    ``sqrt`` in an expression will fail:

    >>> from sympy.utilities.misc import func_name
    >>> func_name(sqrt(x))
    'Pow'
    >>> sqrt(x).has(sqrt)
    False

    To find ``sqrt`` look for ``Pow`` with an exponent of ``1/2``:

    >>> (x + 1/sqrt(x)).find(lambda i: i.is_Pow and abs(i.exp) is S.Half)
    {1/sqrt(x)}

    Parameters
    ==========

    evaluate : bool, optional
        The parameter determines if the expression should be evaluated.
        If ``None``, its value is taken from
        ``global_parameters.evaluate``.

    Examples

    >>> from sympy import cbrt, Symbol

    >>> cbrt(x)
    x**(1/3)

    >>> cbrt(x)**3
    x

    Note that cbrt(x**3) does not simplify to x.

    >>> cbrt(x**3)
    (x**3)**(1/3)

    This is because the two are not equal to each other in general.
    For example, consider `x == -1`:

    >>> from sympy import Eq
    >>> Eq(cbrt(x**3), x).subs(x, -1)
    False

    This is because cbrt computes the principal cube root, this
    identity does hold if `x` is positive:

def root(arg, n, k: int = 0, evaluate: Incomplete | None = None):

    Parameters
    ==========

    k : int, optional
        Should be an integer in $\\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$.
        Defaults to the principal root if $0$.

    evaluate : bool, optional
        The parameter determines if the expression should be evaluated.
        If ``None``, its value is taken from
        ``global_parameters.evaluate``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import root, Rational
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, n

    >>> root(x, 2)
    sqrt(x)

    >>> root(x, 3)
    x**(1/3)

    >>> root(x, n)
    x**(1/n)

    >>> root(x, -Rational(2, 3))
    x**(-3/2)

    To get the k-th n-th root, specify k:

    >>> root(-2, 3, 2)
    -(-1)**(2/3)*2**(1/3)

    To get all n n-th roots you can use the rootof function.
    The following examples show the roots of unity for n
    equal 2, 3 and 4:

    >>> from sympy import rootof

    >>> [rootof(x**2 - 1, i) for i in range(2)]
    [-1, 1]

    >>> [rootof(x**3 - 1,i) for i in range(3)]
    [1, -1/2 - sqrt(3)*I/2, -1/2 + sqrt(3)*I/2]

    >>> [rootof(x**4 - 1,i) for i in range(4)]
    [-1, 1, -I, I]

    SymPy, like other symbolic algebra systems, returns the
    complex root of negative numbers. This is the principal
    root and differs from the text-book result that one might
    be expecting. For example, the cube root of -8 does not
    come back as -2:

    >>> root(-8, 3)
    2*(-1)**(1/3)

    The real_root function can be used to either make the principal
    result real (or simply to return the real root directly):

    >>> from sympy import real_root
    >>> real_root(_)
    -2
    >>> real_root(-32, 5)
    -2

    Alternatively, the n//2-th n-th root of a negative number can be
    computed with root:

    >>> root(-32, 5, 5//2)
    -2

    Parameters
    ==========

    n : int or None, optional
        If *n* is ``None``, then all instances of
        $(-n)^{1/\\text{odd}}$ will be changed to $-n^{1/\\text{odd}}$.
        This will only create a real root of a principal root.
        The presence of other factors may cause the result to not be
        real.

    * Algorithm

    The task can be considered as searching of supremums in the
    directed complete partial orders [1]_.

    The source values are sequentially allocated by the isolated subsets
    in which supremums are searched and result as Max arguments.

    If the resulted supremum is single, then it is returned.

    The isolated subsets are the sets of values which are only the comparable
    with each other in the current set. E.g. natural numbers are comparable with
    each other, but not comparable with the `x` symbol. Another example: the
    symbol `x` with negative assumption is comparable with a natural number.

    Also there are "least" elements, which are comparable with all others,
    and have a zero property (maximum or minimum for all elements).
    For example, in case of $\\infty$, the allocation operation is terminated
    and only this value is returned.

    Assumption:
       - if $A > B > C$ then $A > C$
       - if $A = B$ then $B$ can be removed

    of keyfunc for that element. If ``binary`` is True then a tuple
    with lists ``T`` and ``F`` are returned where ``T`` is a list
    containing elements of seq for which ``keyfunc`` was ``True`` and

    >>> sift(range(5), lambda x: x % 2)

    sift() returns a defaultdict() object, so any key that has no matches will

    Sometimes you expect the results to be binary; the
    results can be unpacked by setting ``binary`` to True:

    >>> sift(range(4), lambda x: x % 2, binary=True)
    ([1, 3], [0, 2])
    >>> sift(Tuple(1, pi), lambda x: x.is_rational, binary=True)
    ([1], [pi])

    A ValueError is raised if the predicate was not actually binary
    (which is a good test for the logic where sifting is used and
    binary results were expected):

    >>> unknown = exp(1) - pi  # the rationality of this is unknown
    >>> args = Tuple(1, pi, unknown)
    >>> sift(args, lambda x: x.is_rational, binary=True)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: keyfunc gave non-binary output

    The non-binary sifting shows that there were 3 keys generated:

    >>> set(sift(args, lambda x: x.is_rational).keys())
    {None, False, True}

    If you need to sort the sifted items it might be better to use
    ``ordered`` which can economically apply multiple sort keys

            A -> C
            B -> C

        >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import strongly_connected_components

        >>> strongly_connected_components((V, E))
        [['D'], ['B', 'C'], ['A']]

    This also gives the components in reverse topological order.

    Since the subgraph containing B and C has a cycle they must be together in
    a strongly connected component. A and D are connected to the rest of the
    graph but not in a cyclic manner so they appear as their own strongly
    connected components.


    Notes
    =====

    The vertices of the graph must be hashable for the data structures used.
    If the vertices are unhashable replace them with integer indices.

    components in `O(|V|+|E|)` (linear) time.

    The weakly connected components of a directed graph can found the same
    way.


    Notes
    =====

    The vertices of the graph must be hashable for the data structures used.
    If the vertices are unhashable replace them with integer indices.

    This function uses Tarjan's algorithm to compute the connected components
    in `O(|V|+|E|)` (linear) time.

    ========

    The number of partitions of a set is given by the bell number:

    >>> from sympy import bell
    >>> len(list(multiset_partitions(5))) == bell(5) == 52
    True

    The number of partitions of length k from a set of size n is given by the
    Stirling Number of the 2nd kind:

    >>> from sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers import stirling
    >>> stirling(5, 2) == len(list(multiset_partitions(5, 2))) == 15
    True

    These comments on counting apply to *sets*, not multisets.

    Notes
    =====

    When all the elements are the same in the multiset, the order
    of the returned partitions is determined by the ``partitions``
    routine. If one is counting partitions then it is better to use
    the ``nT`` function.

def partitions(n, m: Incomplete | None = None, k: Incomplete | None = None, size: bool = False) -> Generator[Incomplete, None, None]:

    Parameters
    ==========

    m : integer (default gives partitions of all sizes)
        limits number of parts in partition (mnemonic: m, maximum parts)
    k : integer (default gives partitions number from 1 through n)
        limits the numbers that are kept in the partition (mnemonic: k, keys)

    Each partition is represented as a dictionary, mapping an integer
    to the number of copies of that integer in the partition.  For example,
    the first partition of 4 returned is {4: 1}, "4: one of them".

    Examples
    ========

    Parameters
    ==========

    m : integer (default None)
        The default value gives partitions of all sizes else only
        those with size m. In addition, if ``m`` is not None then
        partitions are generated *in place* (see examples).
    sort : bool (default True)
        Controls whether partitions are
        returned in sorted order when ``m`` is not None; when False,
        the partitions are returned as fast as possible with elements
        sorted, but when m|n the partitions will not be in
        ascending lexicographical order.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import ordered_partitions

    All partitions of 5 in ascending lexicographical:

    >>> for p in ordered_partitions(5):
    ...     print(p)
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    [1, 1, 1, 2]
    [1, 1, 3]
    [1, 2, 2]
    [1, 4]
    [2, 3]
    [5]

    Only partitions of 5 with two parts:

    >>> for p in ordered_partitions(5, 2):
    ...     print(p)
    [1, 4]
    [2, 3]

    When ``m`` is given, a given list objects will be used more than
    once for speed reasons so you will not see the correct partitions
    unless you make a copy of each as it is generated:

    >>> [p for p in ordered_partitions(7, 3)]
    [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]
    >>> [list(p) for p in ordered_partitions(7, 3)]
    [[1, 1, 5], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 3], [2, 2, 3]]

    When ``n`` is a multiple of ``m``, the elements are still sorted
    but the partitions themselves will be *unordered* if sort is False;
    the default is to return them in ascending lexicographical order.

    >>> for p in ordered_partitions(6, 2):
    ...     print(p)
    [1, 5]
    [2, 4]
    [3, 3]

    But if speed is more important than ordering, sort can be set to
    False:

    >>> for p in ordered_partitions(6, 2, sort=False):
    ...     print(p)

    >>> from itertools import permutations
    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import generate_bell
    >>> from sympy import zeros, Matrix

    This is the sort of permutation used in the ringing of physical bells,
    and does not produce permutations in lexicographical order. Rather, the
    permutations differ from each other by exactly one inversion, and the
    position at which the swapping occurs varies periodically in a simple
    fashion. Consider the first few permutations of 4 elements generated
    by ``permutations`` and ``generate_bell``:

    >>> list(permutations(range(4)))[:5]
    [(0, 1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 3, 2), (0, 2, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3, 1), (0, 3, 1, 2)]
    >>> list(generate_bell(4))[:5]
    [(0, 1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 3, 2), (0, 3, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1, 2), (3, 0, 2, 1)]

    Notice how the 2nd and 3rd lexicographical permutations have 3 elements
    out of place whereas each "bell" permutation always has only two
    elements out of place relative to the previous permutation (and so the
    signature (+/-1) of a permutation is opposite of the signature of the
    previous permutation).

    How the position of inversion varies across the elements can be seen
    by tracing out where the largest number appears in the permutations:

    >>> m = zeros(4, 24)
    >>> for i, p in enumerate(generate_bell(4)):
    ...     m[:, i] = Matrix([j - 3 for j in list(p)])  # make largest zero
    >>> m.print_nonzero(\'X\')
    [XXX  XXXXXX  XXXXXX  XXX]
    [XX XX XXXX XX XXXX XX XX]
    [X XXXX XX XXXX XX XXXX X]
    [ XXXXXX  XXXXXX  XXXXXX ]

    Return the rotation of the sequence in which the lexically smallest
    elements appear first, e.g. `cba \\rightarrow acb`.

    The sequence returned is a tuple, unless the input sequence is a string
    in which case a string is returned.

    If ``directed`` is False then the smaller of the sequence and the
    reversed sequence is returned, e.g. `cba \\rightarrow abc`.

    If ``key`` is not None then it is used to extract a comparison key from each element in iterable.

def iterable(i, exclude=...):
    '''
    Return a boolean indicating whether ``i`` is SymPy iterable.
    True also indicates that the iterator is finite, e.g. you can
    call list(...) on the instance.

    When SymPy is working with iterables, it is almost always assuming
    that the iterable is not a string or a mapping, so those are excluded
    by default. If you want a pure Python definition, make exclude=None. To
    exclude multiple items, pass them as a tuple.

    You can also set the _iterable attribute to True or False on your class,
    which will override the checks here, including the exclude test.

    As a rule of thumb, some SymPy functions use this to check if they should
    recursively map over an object. If an object is technically iterable in
    the Python sense but does not desire this behavior (e.g., because its
    iteration is not finite, or because iteration might induce an unwanted
    computation), it should disable it by setting the _iterable attribute to False.

    Base class for all SymPy objects.

    Notes and conventions
    =====================

    1) Always use ``.args``, when accessing parameters of some instance:

    >>> from sympy import cot
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y

    >>> cot(x).args
    (x,)

    >>> cot(x).args[0]
    x

    >>> (x*y).args
    (x, y)

    >>> (x*y).args[1]
    y


    2) Never use internal methods or variables (the ones prefixed with ``_``):

    >>> cot(x)._args    # do not use this, use cot(x).args instead
    (x,)


    3)  By "SymPy object" we mean something that can be returned by
        ``sympify``.  But not all objects one encounters using SymPy are
        subclasses of Basic.  For example, mutable objects are not:

        >>> from sympy import Basic, Matrix, sympify
        >>> A = Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]]).as_mutable()
        >>> isinstance(A, Basic)
        False

        >>> B = sympify(A)
        >>> isinstance(B, Basic)
        True

        and number symbols like I and pi. It is possible to request
        atoms of any type, however, as demonstrated below.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import I, pi, sin
        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
        >>> (1 + x + 2*sin(y + I*pi)).atoms()
        {1, 2, I, pi, x, y}

        If one or more types are given, the results will contain only

        >>> (1 + x + 2*sin(y + I*pi)).atoms(Number, NumberSymbol, I)
        {1, 2, I, pi}

        Note that I (imaginary unit) and zoo (complex infinity) are special
        types of number symbols and are not part of the NumberSymbol class.

        The type can be given implicitly, too:

        >>> (1 + x + 2*sin(y + I*pi)).atoms(x) # x is a Symbol
        {x, y}

        Be careful to check your assumptions when using the implicit option
        since ``S(1).is_Integer = True`` but ``type(S(1))`` is ``One``, a special type
        of SymPy atom, while ``type(S(2))`` is type ``Integer`` and will find all
        integers in an expression:

        >>> from sympy import S
        >>> (1 + x + 2*sin(y + I*pi)).atoms(S(1))
        {1}

        >>> (1 + x + 2*sin(y + I*pi)).atoms(S(2))
        {1, 2}

        Finally, arguments to atoms() can select more than atomic atoms: any
        SymPy type (loaded in core/__init__.py) can be listed as an argument
        and those types of "atoms" as found in scanning the arguments of the
        expression recursively:

        >>> from sympy import Function, Mul

        >>> (1 + f(x) + 2*sin(y + I*pi)).atoms(AppliedUndef)
        {f(x)}

        >>> (x**2 + x**4).xreplace({x**2: y})
        x**4 + y

        To delay evaluation until all substitutions have been made,
        set the keyword ``simultaneous`` to True:

        >>> (x/y).subs([(x, 0), (y, 0)])
        0
        >>> (x/y).subs([(x, 0), (y, 0)], simultaneous=True)
        nan

        This has the added feature of not allowing subsequent substitutions
        to affect those already made:

        >>> ((x + y)/y).subs({x + y: y, y: x + y})
        1
        >>> ((x + y)/y).subs({x + y: y, y: x + y}, simultaneous=True)
        y/(x + y)

        In order to obtain a canonical result, unordered iterables are
        sorted by count_op length, number of arguments and by the
        default_sort_key to break any ties. All other iterables are left
        unsorted.

        >>> from sympy import sqrt, sin, cos
        >>> from sympy.abc import a, b, c, d, e

        >>> A = (sqrt(sin(2*x)), a)

        >>> expr = sqrt(sin(2*x))*sin(exp(x)*x)*cos(2*x) + sin(2*x)

        >>> expr.subs(dict([A, B, C, D, E]))
        a*c*sin(d*e) + b

        The resulting expression represents a literal replacement of the
        old arguments with the new arguments. This may not reflect the
        limiting behavior of the expression:

        >>> (x**3 - 3*x).subs({x: oo})
        nan

        >>> limit(x**3 - 3*x, x, oo)
        oo

        If the substitution will be followed by numerical
        evaluation, it is better to pass the substitution to
        evalf as

        >>> (1/x).evalf(subs={x: 3.0}, n=21)
        0.333333333333333333333

        rather than

        >>> (1/x).subs({x: 3.0}).evalf(21)
        0.333333333333333314830

        xreplace : the result of the replacement

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import symbols, pi, exp
        >>> x, y, z = symbols('x y z')
        >>> (1 + x*y).xreplace({x: pi})
        pi*y + 1
        >>> (1 + x*y).xreplace({x: pi, y: 2})
        1 + 2*pi

        Replacements occur only if an entire node in the expression tree is
        matched:

        >>> (x*y + z).xreplace({x*y: pi})
        z + pi
        >>> (x*y*z).xreplace({x*y: pi})
        x*y*z
        >>> (2*x).xreplace({2*x: y, x: z})
        y
        >>> (2*2*x).xreplace({2*x: y, x: z})
        4*z
        >>> (x + y + 2).xreplace({x + y: 2})
        x + y + 2
        >>> (x + 2 + exp(x + 2)).xreplace({x + 2: y})
        x + exp(y) + 2

        xreplace does not differentiate between free and bound symbols. In the
        following, subs(x, y) would not change x since it is a bound symbol,
        but xreplace does:

        >>> from sympy import Integral
        >>> Integral(x, (x, 1, 2*x)).xreplace({x: y})
        Integral(y, (y, 1, 2*y))

        Trying to replace x with an expression raises an error:

        >>> Integral(x, (x, 1, 2*x)).xreplace({x: 2*y}) # doctest: +SKIP
        ValueError: Invalid limits given: ((2*y, 1, 4*y),)

        >>> x.has(x)

        Note ``has`` is a structural algorithm with no knowledge of
        mathematics. Consider the following half-open interval:

        >>> from sympy import Interval

        Interval.Lopen(0, 5)

        False
        >>> i.has(0)  # there *is* a "0" in the arguments
        True

        Instead, use ``contains`` to determine whether a number is in the
        interval or not:

        >>> i.contains(4)
        True
        >>> i.contains(0)
        False


        Note that ``expr.has(*patterns)`` is exactly equivalent to
        ``any(expr.has(p) for p in patterns)``. In particular, ``False`` is
        returned when the list of patterns is empty.

        >>> x.has()

        Replace matching subexpressions of ``self`` with ``value``.

        If ``map = True`` then also return the mapping {old: new} where ``old``
        was a sub-expression found with query and ``new`` is the replacement
        value for it. If the expression itself does not match the query, then
        the returned value will be ``self.xreplace(map)`` otherwise it should
        be ``self.subs(ordered(map.items()))``.

        Traverses an expression tree and performs replacement of matching
        subexpressions from the bottom to the top of the tree. The default
        approach is to do the replacement in a simultaneous fashion so
        changes made are targeted only once. If this is not desired or causes
        problems, ``simultaneous`` can be set to False.

        In addition, if an expression containing more than one Wild symbol
        is being used to match subexpressions and the ``exact`` flag is None
        it will be set to True so the match will only succeed if all non-zero
        values are received for each Wild that appears in the match pattern.
        Setting this to False accepts a match of 0; while setting it True
        accepts all matches that have a 0 in them. See example below for
        cautions.

        The list of possible combinations of queries and replacement values
        is listed below:

        Examples
        ========

        Initial setup

        >>> from sympy import log, sin, cos, tan, Wild, Mul, Add
        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
        >>> f = log(sin(x)) + tan(sin(x**2))

        1.1. type -> type
            obj.replace(type, newtype)

            When object of type ``type`` is found, replace it with the
            result of passing its argument(s) to ``newtype``.

            >>> f.replace(sin, cos)
            log(cos(x)) + tan(cos(x**2))
            >>> sin(x).replace(sin, cos, map=True)
            (cos(x), {sin(x): cos(x)})
            >>> (x*y).replace(Mul, Add)
            x + y

        1.2. type -> func
            obj.replace(type, func)

            When object of type ``type`` is found, apply ``func`` to its
            argument(s). ``func`` must be written to handle the number
            of arguments of ``type``.

            >>> f.replace(sin, lambda arg: sin(2*arg))
            log(sin(2*x)) + tan(sin(2*x**2))
            >>> (x*y).replace(Mul, lambda *args: sin(2*Mul(*args)))
            sin(2*x*y)

        2.1. pattern -> expr
            obj.replace(pattern(wild), expr(wild))

            Replace subexpressions matching ``pattern`` with the expression
            written in terms of the Wild symbols in ``pattern``.

            >>> a, b = map(Wild, 'ab')
            >>> f.replace(sin(a), tan(a))
            log(tan(x)) + tan(tan(x**2))
            >>> f.replace(sin(a), tan(a/2))
            log(tan(x/2)) + tan(tan(x**2/2))
            >>> f.replace(sin(a), a)
            log(x) + tan(x**2)
            >>> (x*y).replace(a*x, a)
            y

            Matching is exact by default when more than one Wild symbol
            is used: matching fails unless the match gives non-zero
            values for all Wild symbols:

            >>> (2*x + y).replace(a*x + b, b - a)
            y - 2
            >>> (2*x).replace(a*x + b, b - a)
            2*x

            When set to False, the results may be non-intuitive:

            >>> (2*x).replace(a*x + b, b - a, exact=False)
            2/x

        2.2. pattern -> func
            obj.replace(pattern(wild), lambda wild: expr(wild))

            All behavior is the same as in 2.1 but now a function in terms of
            pattern variables is used rather than an expression:

            >>> f.replace(sin(a), lambda a: sin(2*a))
            log(sin(2*x)) + tan(sin(2*x**2))

        3.1. func -> func
            obj.replace(filter, func)

            Replace subexpression ``e`` with ``func(e)`` if ``filter(e)``
            is True.

            >>> g = 2*sin(x**3)
            >>> g.replace(lambda expr: expr.is_Number, lambda expr: expr**2)
            4*sin(x**9)

        The expression itself is also targeted by the query but is done in
        such a fashion that changes are not made twice.

            >>> e = x*(x*y + 1)
            >>> e.replace(lambda x: x.is_Mul, lambda x: 2*x)
            2*x*(2*x*y + 1)

        When matching a single symbol, `exact` will default to True, but
        this may or may not be the behavior that is desired:

        Here, we want `exact=False`:

        >>> from sympy import Function
        >>> f = Function('f')
        >>> e = f(1) + f(0)
        >>> q = f(a), lambda a: f(a + 1)
        >>> e.replace(*q, exact=False)
        f(1) + f(2)
        >>> e.replace(*q, exact=True)
        f(0) + f(2)

        But here, the nature of matching makes selecting
        the right setting tricky:

        >>> e = x**(1 + y)
        >>> (x**(1 + y)).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=False)
        x
        >>> (x**(1 + y)).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=True)
        x**(-x - y + 1)
        >>> (x**y).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=False)
        x
        >>> (x**y).replace(x**(1 + a), lambda a: x**-a, exact=True)
        x**(1 - y)

        It is probably better to use a different form of the query
        that describes the target expression more precisely:

        >>> (1 + x**(1 + y)).replace(
        ... lambda x: x.is_Pow and x.exp.is_Add and x.exp.args[0] == 1,
        ... lambda x: x.base**(1 - (x.exp - 1)))
        ...
        x**(1 - y) + 1

        functions as gamma function.

        *pattern* is optional parameter which defines the types of expressions
        that will be transformed. If it is not passed, all possible expressions
        will be rewritten. *rule* defines how the expression will be rewritten.

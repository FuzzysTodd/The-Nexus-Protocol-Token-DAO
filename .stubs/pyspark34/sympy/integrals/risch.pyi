def integer_powers(exprs):
    """
    Rewrites a list of expressions as integer multiples of each other.

    Explanation
    ===========

    For example, if you have [x, x/2, x**2 + 1, 2*x/3], then you can rewrite
    this as [(x/6) * 6, (x/6) * 3, (x**2 + 1) * 1, (x/6) * 4]. This is useful
    in the Risch integration algorithm, where we must write exp(x) + exp(x/2)
    as (exp(x/2))**2 + exp(x/2), but not as exp(x) + sqrt(exp(x)) (this is
    because only the transcendental case is implemented and we therefore cannot
    integrate algebraic extensions). The integer multiples returned by this
    function for each term are the smallest possible (their content equals 1).

    Returns a list of tuples where the first element is the base term and the
    second element is a list of `(item, factor)` terms, where `factor` is the
    integer multiplicative factor that must multiply the base term to obtain
    the original item.

    The easiest way to understand this is to look at an example:

    >>> from sympy.abc import x
    >>> from sympy.integrals.risch import integer_powers
    >>> integer_powers([x, x/2, x**2 + 1, 2*x/3])
    [(x/6, [(x, 6), (x/2, 3), (2*x/3, 4)]), (x**2 + 1, [(x**2 + 1, 1)])]

    We can see how this relates to the example at the beginning of the
    docstring.  It chose x/6 as the first base term.  Then, x can be written as
    (x/2) * 2, so we get (0, 2), and so on. Now only element (x**2 + 1)
    remains, and there are no other terms that can be written as a rational
    multiple of that, so we get that it can be written as (x**2 + 1) * 1.

class DifferentialExtension:
    """
    A container for all the information relating to a differential extension.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The attributes of this object are (see also the docstring of __init__):

    - f: The original (Expr) integrand.
    - x: The variable of integration.
    - T: List of variables in the extension.
    - D: List of derivations in the extension; corresponds to the elements of T.
    - fa: Poly of the numerator of the integrand.
    - fd: Poly of the denominator of the integrand.
    - Tfuncs: Lambda() representations of each element of T (except for x).
      For back-substitution after integration.
    - backsubs: A (possibly empty) list of further substitutions to be made on
      the final integral to make it look more like the integrand.
    - exts:
    - extargs:
    - cases: List of string representations of the cases of T.
    - t: The top level extension variable, as defined by the current level
      (see level below).
    - d: The top level extension derivation, as defined by the current
      derivation (see level below).
    - case: The string representation of the case of self.d.
    (Note that self.T and self.D will always contain the complete extension,
    regardless of the level.  Therefore, you should ALWAYS use DE.t and DE.d
    instead of DE.T[-1] and DE.D[-1].  If you want to have a list of the
    derivations or variables only up to the current level, use
    DE.D[:len(DE.D) + DE.level + 1] and DE.T[:len(DE.T) + DE.level + 1].  Note
    that, in particular, the derivation() function does this.)

    The following are also attributes, but will probably not be useful other
    than in internal use:
    - newf: Expr form of fa/fd.
    - level: The number (between -1 and -len(self.T)) such that
      self.T[self.level] == self.t and self.D[self.level] == self.d.

    If the result of integrate() is an instance of this class, it is

    The Risch Integration Algorithm.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Only transcendental functions are supported.  Currently, only exponentials
    and logarithms are supported, but support for trigonometric functions is
    forthcoming.

    If this function returns an unevaluated Integral in the result, it means
    that it has proven that integral to be nonelementary.  Any errors will
    result in raising NotImplementedError.  The unevaluated Integral will be
    an instance of NonElementaryIntegral, a subclass of Integral.

    handle_first may be either 'exp' or 'log'.  This changes the order in
    which the extension is built, and may result in a different (but
    equivalent) solution (for an example of this, see issue 5109).  It is also
    possible that the integral may be computed with one but not the other,
    because not all cases have been implemented yet.  It defaults to 'log' so
    that the outer extension is exponential when possible, because more of the
    exponential case has been implemented.

    If ``separate_integral`` is ``True``, the result is returned as a tuple (ans, i),
    where the integral is ans + i, ans is elementary, and i is either a
    NonElementaryIntegral or 0.  This useful if you want to try further
    integrating the NonElementaryIntegral part using other algorithms to
    possibly get a solution in terms of special functions.  It is False by
    default.

    First, we try integrating exp(-x**2). Except for a constant factor of
    2/sqrt(pi), this is the famous error function.

    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(exp(-x**2), x))
      /
     |
     |    2
     |  -x
     | e    dx
     |
    /

    The unevaluated Integral in the result means that risch_integrate() has
    proven that exp(-x**2) does not have an elementary anti-derivative.

    In many cases, risch_integrate() can split out the elementary
    anti-derivative part from the nonelementary anti-derivative part.
    For example,

    >>> pprint(risch_integrate((2*log(x)**2 - log(x) - x**2)/(log(x)**3 -
    ... x**2*log(x)), x))
                                             /
                                            |
      log(-x + log(x))   log(x + log(x))    |   1
    - ---------------- + --------------- +  | ------ dx
             2                  2           | log(x)
                                            |
                                           /

    This means that it has proven that the integral of 1/log(x) is
    nonelementary.  This function is also known as the logarithmic integral,
    and is often denoted as Li(x).

    risch_integrate() currently only accepts purely transcendental functions
    with exponentials and logarithms, though note that this can include
    nested exponentials and logarithms, as well as exponentials with bases
    other than E.

    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(exp(x)*exp(exp(x)), x))
     / x\\\n     \\e /
    e
    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(exp(exp(x)), x))
      /
     |
     |  / x\\\n     |  \\e /
     | e     dx
     |
    /

    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(x*x**x*log(x) + x**x + x*x**x, x))
       x
    x*x
    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(x**x, x))
      /
     |
     |  x
     | x  dx
     |
    /

    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(-1/(x*log(x)*log(log(x))**2), x))
         1
    -----------
    log(log(x))

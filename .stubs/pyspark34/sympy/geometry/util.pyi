    Parameters
    ==========

    y : the dependent variable or a list of dependent variables (with y first)
    x : the variable that the derivative is being taken with respect to
    n : the order of the derivative (default is 1)

    Parameters
    ==========
    entities : sequence of GeometryEntity

    Returns
    =======
    intersection : list of GeometryEntity

    Raises
    ======
    NotImplementedError
        When unable to calculate intersection.

    Notes
    =====
    The intersection of any geometrical entity with itself should return
    a list with one item: the entity in question.
    An intersection requires two or more entities. If only a single
    entity is given then the function will return an empty list.
    It is possible for `intersection` to miss intersections that one
    knows exists because the required quantities were not fully
    simplified internally.
    Reals should be converted to Rationals, e.g. Rational(str(real_num))
    or else failures due to floating point issues may result.

    Case 1: When the keyword argument 'pairwise' is False (default value):
    In this case, the function returns a list of intersections common to
    all entities.

    Case 2: When the keyword argument 'pairwise' is True:
    In this case, the functions returns a list intersections that occur
    between any pair of entities.

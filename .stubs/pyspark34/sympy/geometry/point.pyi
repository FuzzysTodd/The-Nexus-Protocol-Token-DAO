class Point(GeometryEntity):

    Parameters
    ==========

    coords : sequence of n-coordinate values. In the special
        case where n=2 or 3, a Point2D or Point3D will be created
        as appropriate.
    evaluate : if `True` (default), all floats are turn into
        exact types.
    dim : number of coordinates the point should have.  If coordinates
        are unspecified, they are padded with zeros.
    on_morph : indicates what should happen when the number of
        coordinates of a point need to be changed by adding or
        removing zeros.  Possible values are `'warn'`, `'error'`, or
        `ignore` (default).  No warning or error is given when `*args`
        is empty and `dim` is given. An error is always raised when
        trying to remove nonzero coordinates.


    Attributes
    ==========

    length
    origin: A `Point` representing the origin of the
        appropriately-dimensioned space.

    Raises
    ======

    ValueError : when instantiating with a sequence with length < 2 or
        when trying to reduce dimensions if keyword `on_morph='error'` is
        set.

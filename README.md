## What is Nexus Protocol?

Nexus Protocol is a real project combining:
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** tools and protocols
- **Smart Contract** management interfaces
- **DAO Governance** structures
- **NGTT Token** ecosystem with multiple reward mechanisms

Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for Web3 - your gateway to managing crypto assets, participating in DAOs, and exploring blockchain technology.

## Key Components

### 🎯 NGTT Token
The Nexus Game Theory Token is the ecosystem's utility token with governance rights, reward distribution, and staking capabilities.

### 🎮 Games Arcade
A polished browser arcade for playable Nexus mini-games, strategy drills, and the age-group game catalog.

### 💼 Withdrawal Manager
A simple web interface to manage withdrawals from your smart contracts using MetaMask.

### 🌐 Web3 Directory
Your dashboard to navigate various DeFi protocols including Uniswap, Aave, Chainlink, Nouns DAO, and more.

### 📋 Governance System
Structured authority with Owner (FuzzysTodd), Master Project Controller (MPC), and Super Delegates.

## Marketing Path

The Nexus Protocol's marketing strategy is fully documented in **[MARKETING_PATH.md](MARKETING_PATH.md)**.

The marketing path moves participants through five phases:

| Phase | Goal |
|---|---|
| **Awareness** | Discovery via social media, content, influencers, GitHub |
| **Acquisition** | DEX listing, airdrop, onboarding funnel, token purchase |
| **Activation** | First game played, first NGTT earned, wallet connected |
| **Retention** | DAO governance, MCP groups, boost events, dividend cycles |
| **Revenue** | All 10 streams from `CRYPTO_REVENUE_GUIDE.md` — passive + active |

See [`MARKETING_PATH.md`](MARKETING_PATH.md) for the complete go-to-market strategy, launch roadmap, brand guide, KPIs, and phase-by-phase conclusions.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Base URL

Edit `playwright.config.js`:

```javascript
baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',  // Change port here
```

### Adjust Timing

Edit `scripts/web3-automation.js`:

```javascript
slowMo: 1000,      // Milliseconds between actions
timeout: 300000    // How long to wait (5 min = 300000ms)
```

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### MetaMask Not Detected

- Install MetaMask browser extension
- Refresh the page
- Make sure you're using Chrome/Chromium

### Connection Issues

```bash
# Make sure server is running:
cd .. && python3 -m http.server 3000

# In another terminal, run automation:
cd playwright-tool
npm run web3-automate
```

### Browser Closes Too Fast

Edit `web3-automation.js` and increase timeout:

```javascript
await page.waitForTimeout(300000); // 5 minutes
// Change to:
await page.waitForTimeout(600000); // 10 minutes
```

## 🎓 Tips for Maximum Efficiency

1. **Keep the automation running** - It will wait while you approve transactions
2. **Use the highlights** - Green borders show what to click
3. **Check screenshots** - If something goes wrong, check the saved screenshots
4. **Batch operations** - Add all your contracts first, then withdraw from all at once
5. **Rerun anytime** - The automation is idempotent - safe to run multiple times
